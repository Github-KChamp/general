For Class



I am Kyle C, my future carrer goals are to possibly work with a company that works with online audits or does ethical hacking. 
My current skillset is basics (if not slightly more) of networking and IT security, and I also have some linux knowledge, and can read a few coding languages.
I enjoy pentesting against myself on a home network to see what its like to both be hacked and do the hacking, even if a lot of the stuff I experiment with has only been reviewed by me, not created.
